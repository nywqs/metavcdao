      <p>
        Meta VC Dao is a decentralized VC (venture capital) organization. Based
        on the concept of sharing economy, it is constrained by smart contracts,
        to jointly create, acquire and distribute community value. It aims to
        build a credible, safe, and accessible investment platform for the
        public, so that everyone has an equal opportunity to invest in
        cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meta VC Dao brings together traditional investment institutions, DeFi
        investment analysis teams, IT engineers, market value management teams,
        incubation teams, early blockchain members and thousands of high-quality
        promotion communities around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meta VC Dao sets the early decision-making & co-governance members and
        VC fund pool by issuing equity NFTs. Decision-making & co-governance
        members have the right to propose, invest and make profits. Passed
        Project proposals would receive investment from Meta VC Dao, and the
        investment income will be distributed to NFT holders.
